## About the project
Buy local, and buy fresh with Talipapa. Talipapa is an innovative online platform designed to connect farmers, gardeners, and other producers with local consumers interested in purchasing fresh, locally-sourced products. By facilitating seamless interactions and transactions for consumers and providing a space for sellers to market their products, similar to the traditional local palengke, Talipapa is poised to make a positive impact on local economies and promote more sustainable practices on food supply and logistics. Browse through a feed of products being sold by sellers near you. Keen to be a suki? Follow local sellers and be kept up to date about their products. Talipapa allows you to directly interact and transact with sellers, adding no complexities to transactions and logistics. Have something to sell, maybe from your own crop harvest, catch, or recent fruit picking? Sign up as a seller, setup your commerce profile and start selling.
